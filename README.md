## Installation
* Acquire a server jar, I recommend [Paper 1.21.5](https://papermc.io/downloads/all?project=paper)
* Start your server in a dedicated folder for it, open the eula.txt and read the EULA provided inside the file - then set eula to true.
* Inside the directory `serverroot/plugins`, put [ProjectKorra](https://github.com/ProjectKorra/ProjectKorra/)
* Restart your server
* Put the latest version of AlmostEnoughAbilities in `serverroot/plugins`.
* Restart the server again.

  All set now! You can edit the values for each ability inside `serverroot/plugins/AlmostEnoughAbilities/config.yml`.
  
  You will need either server operator privileges or use a permission plugin to give yourself the permission via a permission plugin like [LuckPerms](https://github.com/LuckPerms/LuckPerms)
